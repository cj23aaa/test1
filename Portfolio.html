    <h1>My Technical interests is in Artificial intelligence </h1>
    <p>As of right now I have not completed or started any AI projects but plan to in the future.<br>
      However I have completed a timed car game called drift racers where the player races around different tracks in order to beat their own time.<br>
      I completed this project with a group of friends and we were called Awesome Gnome Softworks as this was for a university unit. <br>
      I was incharge of creating the menus and the minimap for the project. To find out more about the project click on this link.</p>
