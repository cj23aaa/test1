          <h1>Technical interests </h1>
        <p>My Main  interest is in artificial intelligence but I also have an interest in games development using unity. 
          My main draw to ai is the vast variety of areas it can be used in such as military, agriculture, socially, economically ,etc.</p>

          <h1>Agriculture </h1>
        <p>In agriculture, ai can be used to track and manage plants so that they are planted in the correct season and that they have the correct resources they need to grow in a preferred manner to increase the yield of crops.<br>
          The use of ai can also manage the correct swapping of crops throughout the year.</p>

            <img src="images/ai-art-comparison.jpg" alt="Socially pic" style="width:75%" style="height: 75%;">
          <h1>Socially</h1>
          <p>Socially using ai you are able to get better targeted ads and recommended products for the user that match their interests.<br>
            It is also able to recommend content that matches the users interests and views that the user is more likely to enjoy or find engaging.While some businesses use these strategies to their benefit many people consider it to be unethical. Other issues people consider the use of ai to be unethical is use in artwork since artists are concerned 
            they will lose business since people can use readily available ai to do the same however in my personal opinion it should be ok to use ai to create artwork since it is cheaper than commissioning an artist but this will be a bigger point of contention in the future as ai gets better at making art and at some point will be better than most artists.
            However in my opinion using ai to replicate someone's voice in a game or for music is wrong since the voices belong to the people that are the voice actors and using ai to replicate that is just wrong.</p>

          <h1>Economically </h1>
        <p>The use of ai economically can be good since it can track things like the stock market and crypto.<br>
          This is good since it is relatively accessible to everyday people so that means everyone has an entry into these markets that used to be dominated by people that are richer and so it provides everyone the same footing as each other.</p>

          <h1>Games development</h1>
          <p>My interest in games development comes from my love of video games and wondering how they work and how different game engines use different coding languages to implement features. <br>
            Personally I have only worked with Unity which uses c++ and I found it fun and existing since it was the first time I had ever used Unity and enjoyed learning how it works.</p>
